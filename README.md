Degenerative Disc Disease in the neck ToolbOX is a tool for preprocessing and classifying X-Ray imaging of the neck. It allows researchers to automatically classify the level of degeneration on the discs in the neck by only inputting the X-Ray imaging into the tooling. It does so by leveraging machine learning on imaging.
